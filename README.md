# Chrome Extensions API Dash Docset

## Prereqs

Fairly recent version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## "I want to run the script and get the latest docs!"

In that case, download this repo and run `npm i && npm run build` in the project directory.
If successful, your docset will be rendered in two formats -- as a `.docset` folder and a `.tgz` file.

## "I don't want to regenerate the docs!"

Visit the [Releases page](https://github.com/cuylerstuwe/chrome-extensions-api-dash-docset/releases) to download the latest docset I've compiled.
